&#8203;**CineLuxe** is a high-end administrative interface built to streamline cinema operations. This project showcases my ability to develop complex **CRUD** systems and manage relational databases while maintaining a premium, "Glassmorphism" inspired user experience.

### Key Features

- **Movie Management (CRUD):** Complete control over the movie catalog, allowing admins to add, edit, and archive titles with full metadata support.
- **Advanced Hall Management:** Manage cinema halls (Standard, IMAX, 4DX) with a **Soft Delete** feature to deactivate rooms without losing historical data.
- **Dynamic Screening Schedules:** A smart scheduling system to link movies, halls, and time slots, ensuring efficient theater utilization.
- **Secure Backend Architecture:** Developed with **PHP PDO** to ensure secure database interactions and robust protection against SQL injection.
- **Luxury UI/UX:** A sleek, cinematic dark theme utilizing modern CSS techniques like **Grid**, **Flexbox**, and glass-style overlays.
