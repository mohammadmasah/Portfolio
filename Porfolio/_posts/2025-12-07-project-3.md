&#8203;In this version of **Klivio**, I migrated the entire design to **Tailwind CSS** to demonstrate my ability to build consistent, scalable, and high-performance interfaces. This project focuses on rapid styling without leaving the HTML.

###  Key Features

- **Tailwind Architecture:** Utilized utility-first classes for consistent spacing, typography, and brand identity.
- **Modular Components:** Built reusable UI components including a Hero section with gradient overlays and a grid-based Course Catalog.
- **Performance Focused:** Clean codebase optimized for fast rendering and professional aesthetics.
- **Modern Branding:** Integrated Montserrat typography and Font Awesome icons for a premium look.
