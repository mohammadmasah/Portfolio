&#8203;In the **CV Generator** project, I developed a functional tool for resume building that focuses on **robust data validation** and **optimized HTML-to-PDF rendering**. This project demonstrates my ability to manage complex forms and facilitate seamless interaction between backend logic and frontend presentation.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Preview:** Users can see their resume update instantly as they type, providing a smooth and interactive UX.
- **Dynamic Field Management:** Implemented custom Vanilla JS functions to allow users to add or remove unlimited sections for education, work experience, and skills.
- **Smart Validation:** Integrated advanced **RegEx** patterns to validate emails, international phone codes, and URLs in real-time before submission.
- **Professional PDF Export:** Powered by the **Dompdf** library to ensure high-fidelity conversion from web styles to print-ready PDF documents.
- **Responsive Architecture:** Built with a "mobile-first" approach using Bootstrap 5 and custom Media Queries for accessibility across all devices.
